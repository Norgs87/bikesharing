### The last graph, shows that as the users average age decreases, the average trip length increases on a whole. 

## Summary
### By looking at the heatmaps and graphs that we created, that are a couple of points that we can conclude
- Most of the users of the bikes are subscribers who use the bikes before and after normal working hours for short trips around the city.
- When looking to adapt this model to Des Moines you would have to look at how many poeple live within 5-15 min of biking distance to their place of work to see if the data would act the samee.
- A visilization that would be nice to see is the reason for biking i.e traveling to/from work, leasure, or just to get around the city faster.
- Another visulization that I think would be helpful would be to see the cost to users vs. other modes of transportation in the city ex. (subway pass, bus pass, gas prices) to see if some usage is finicial motivated.
